# HQP_task_transition

This is the continuous transition algorithm using Hierarchical Qudratic Programming(HQP). The abstract and video clips are avaliable in the following website: http://dyros.snu.ac.kr/HQPtasks
This code is based on https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid. Based on TSID code, I rewrote the code in order to use in Windows and Linux with V-Rep.
This code can control mobile manipulator with single arm and non-holonomic mobile base.
Dependancy: qpOASES (for solgving QP), Eigen (for calculating linear algebra), RBDL (for getting a robot dynamics).
